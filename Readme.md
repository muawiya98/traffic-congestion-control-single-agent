* **codes: contains code files** 

    > configuration.py : Emulator variables and settings
    > drone.py : class of drone to build drone and set characteristics to it
    > sumoVaribles: to store the varibles like queue length, velocity, ...etc
    > main.py : to assemble the code and run project
